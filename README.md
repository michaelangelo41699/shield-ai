# shield-ai

Shield is an AI-powered self-awareness system designed to help users
understand how digital content, notifications, and online interactions
influence their emotions, attention, and decision-making.

Rather than censoring content, Shield focuses on reflection,
context, and psychological insight.

Some components are experimental and not production-ready.
