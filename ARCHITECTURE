# Shield AI — Architecture Overview

Shield is built as a layered system that separates
data collection, analysis, and reflection.

This separation is intentional — it protects privacy,
maintains explainability, and prevents overreach.

## Core Layers

###  1. Android App (Client Layer)

Responsibilities:
- Collect behavioral signals (notifications, app usage, time patterns)
- Allow manual user reflections (journaling, mood check-ins)
- Display insights, reflections, and summaries
- Handle permissions and privacy controls

Key Principle:
> Raw data stays on-device whenever possible.

### 🧾 2. Guardian Logger (Observation Layer)

Responsibilities:
- Capture **events**, not raw content
- Normalize inputs into structured behavioral logs
- Tag events with time, context, and category

Examples:
- “User received 37 notifications in 2 hours”
- “User opened social media during focus window”
- “Repeated exposure to comparison-based content”

No personal messages, passwords, or private text is stored.

###  3. Guardian Insight Engine (Interpretation Layer)

Responsibilities:
- Pattern detection (distraction loops, comparison cycles, anxiety triggers)
- Emotional inference (stress, motivation, fatigue, focus)
- Alignment analysis (behavior vs stated goals)

This layer is largely deterministic + ML-based,
producing **explainable signals**.

###  4. Guardian AI / Guardian Voice (Reasoning Layer)

Responsibilities:
- Convert signals into human-understandable insights
- Provide psychological framing and reflection
- Ask meaningful questions that promote awareness
- Adapt tone based on emotional context

Hybrid approach:
- Lightweight classifiers → fast detection
- LLM reasoning → nuance, empathy, insight

## Why This Architecture Matters

- Privacy-first by design
- Modular and auditable
- Prevents “black box” manipulation
- Enables future on-device inference
- Allows Guardian to intervene **without spying**

Shield is intentionally not a monolith.
Each layer has boundaries — just like a healthy mind.
