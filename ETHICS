# Shield AI — Ethics & Privacy

Shield is built on the principle that
**technology should increase human agency, not replace it.**

This document defines the ethical boundaries of the system.

---

## Core Ethical Principles

### 1. User Sovereignty

- The user owns their data
- The user controls visibility
- The user can disable or delete data at any time

Shield exists to serve the user — not to guide, shape, or optimize them for external goals.

---

### 2. Privacy by Design

- No long-term storage of raw content
- No selling or sharing of user data
- Behavioral signals are abstracted, not recorded verbatim
- Sensitive inference is local whenever possible

Shield does not monetize attention.
Shield protects it.

---

### 3. Psychological Safety

Shield does **not**:
- Diagnose mental illness
- Replace therapy
- Provide medical or legal advice

Guardian responses are reflective, not authoritative.

When distress signals exceed safe thresholds,
Shield is designed to recommend **external human support**.

---

### 4. No Behavioral Manipulation

Shield never:
- Nudges for engagement
- Pushes content for profit
- Uses reinforcement loops to control behavior

Guardian may interrupt patterns,
but it never coerces decisions.

---

### 5. Transparency

- Insights are explainable
- Triggers are named
- Patterns are surfaced, not hidden

Users are told *why* something is flagged.

---

## Ethical Boundary Statement

Shield will never:
- Act without user consent
- Exploit emotional vulnerability
- Track users across devices or identities
- Become an invisible influence system

Shield exists to **undo** those systems — not copy them.
